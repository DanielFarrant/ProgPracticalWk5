        <h1>Uses of Computer Science in Medicine</h1>
        <p>There are many ways that Computer Science is used in Medicine. These include:</p>
        <h2>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</h2>
        <p>This is an imaging technique that is used to produce 3D images that can be examined by a dcotor in order to make a diagnosis on a patient. Computers are used to piece together the thousands of scan images and create a 3D image of electrical activity in that region.</p>
        <h2>Computer Networking</h2>
        <p>This allows patient records to be shared much more quickly than previously possible</p>
